# Distribution Convergence

This Shiny application shows visually an index of convergence between statistical distributions.

Given two density functions the convergence between both is mearures by their overlaping area, hence the index is bounded between 0, no overlaping area, and 1, both distributions are identical.

The user has control over the mean and standard deviation of both distibutions, and the overlaping are is shown in red. This area, which is the proposed index, is shown at the bottom of the left panel.

Enjoy!
