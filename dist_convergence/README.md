# Catching-up and Distribution Convergence

This _Shiny_ application shows visually an index of catching-up and convergence between two statistical distributions.

Given two density functions the convergence between both is measured by an index related to their overlapping area, hence the index is bounded between 0, no overlapping area, and 1, full overlapping, so both distributions are identical.

The user has control over the mean and standard deviation of both distributions on the left panel, and also on the sensibility parameter. The overlapping area is shown in red to the right. This area, together with the intersection area and the catching-up index, in percentage form, is shown at the bottom of the left panel.

For more details, and real example application, see the research note: **Goerlich, F. J. (2019)** _A simple non-parametric catching-up and convergence index_. Manuscript.

Enjoy!
