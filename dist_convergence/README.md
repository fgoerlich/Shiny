# Distribution Convergence

This Shiny application shows visually an index of convergence between statistical distributions.

Given two density functions the convergence between both is mearured by their overlaping area, hence the index is bounded between 0, no overlaping area, and 1, both distributions are identical.

The user has control over the mean and standard deviation of both distibutions on the left panel, and the overlaping are is shown in red to the right. This area, which is the proposed index, is shown at the bottom of the left panel.

Enjoy!
