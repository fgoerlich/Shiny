## The ups and down of employment opportunities

A nice Shiny app showing the potential to comunicate statistica results with a plot a some associated comments.

This time series plot shows the quarterly unmenployment rate in the spanish economy since we have data from the National Statistical Institute.

Clearly female unemployment has been traditionally higher than male unemployment, but they have been more or less in line during short periods of time.

Notably during the last recession the huge increase in unemployment worsen opportunities for males, so their unmenployment rate caught the female unemployment rate, while both were showing an upward trend. Notice than in the recent quarters unemployment rate from males is falling quicker that unemployment rates for females.

Hence, male unemployment shows greater sensitivy to cyclical conditions in th economy than female unemployment.

Enjoy!
